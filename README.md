# MendotaRS
Code for remote sensing of harmful algae indicators on Lake Mendota

The "RSandWQLesson" code is being developed as a lesson plan for outreach purposes. 
All other code was used directly in the development of the RS tool documented in the manuscript:
"A Machine Learning and Remote Sensing-based Model for Algae Pigment and Dissolved Oxygen Retrieval on a Small Inland Lake"
